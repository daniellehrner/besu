/**
 * Stores the bodies and receipts of the blocks a snap sync left for later, and keeps track of which
 * of them are still missing.
 *
 * <p>The batches arrive in the order their downloads complete. Each one is stored when it arrives.
 * The range of missing blocks recorded with the chain only shrinks over blocks that have every
 * block before them stored, so a download that is interrupted continues from there and downloads
 * what was stored ahead of it again.
 *
 * <p>The node follows the chain while this runs, and the blocks it imports go to the same storage.
 * So a batch is only stored once the storage has written out what it was given before, and after
 * waiting for that this step stays idle for as long again: stored as fast as they arrive, the
 * batches fill the write buffers faster than they are flushed, which stops every write to the
 * storage, and they leave the disk no room for the reads a new block needs.
